# üñºÔ∏è Image Processing & OCR with OpenCV and Tesseract

This project demonstrates the use of **OpenCV** for basic image processing tasks and **Tesseract OCR** for extracting text from images. It covers both traditional computer vision techniques and optical character recognition using pre-trained tools.

## ‚úÖ What This Project Does

This notebook performs the following key tasks:

### üîç 1. Edge Detection
- Uses **convolution filters** and **custom kernels** (like the Sobel filter) to identify edges in images.
- Demonstrates how edge detection highlights vertical, horizontal, or diagonal features.
- Explains the difference between OpenCV filters and deep learning kernels (which are learned vs. manually set).

### ‚ö° 2. Canny Edge Detection
- Implements OpenCV‚Äôs built-in `cv2.Canny()` function.
- Provides more refined, noise-reduced edge detection using automatic thresholds and gradient intensity.
- Useful for preparing images for further processing like segmentation or OCR.

### üßæ 3. Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- Extracts text from images using the **Tesseract** engine via the `pytesseract` wrapper.
- Starts with a simple image and shows how text is extracted easily.
- Then applies the same OCR process to a complex or noisy image, which initially fails.

### üõ†Ô∏è 4. Image Preprocessing for OCR
To improve OCR results on difficult images, the following preprocessing steps are applied:
- **Grayscale conversion**: Simplifies color info into intensity levels.
- **Thresholding**: Binarizes the image (black & white) to improve text clarity.
- **Noise removal**: Removes irrelevant pixels to clean the image.
- **Image scaling**: Increases resolution to improve character recognition.

These steps demonstrate how preprocessing enhances OCR accuracy significantly.

### üñºÔ∏è 5. Visualization
- Custom plotting functions are used to display:
  - Original images
  - Filtered/processed versions
  - OCR results
- Helpful for comparing effects of different techniques visually.
